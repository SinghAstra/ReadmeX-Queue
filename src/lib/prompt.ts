## üìå README FORMAT

1. Start with the **repository name** as the top-level heading using \`#\`.
2. Add a **short overview** of the repository under top level Heading. This should explain what the project does in 1‚Äì3 sentences, based on the types of files and functionality inferred from the summaries.
3. Add a section called \`## üß∞ Technology Stack\` listing the key technologies used in the project and their role with markdown table listing:
   - Technology (left column)
   - Purpose/Role (right column)
3. Add a section called \`## üìÅ File Structure and Purpose\` with a markdown table listing:
   - File Path (left column)
   - Summary/Description (right column)
4. Use the **exact markdown table format** below for reference (you must replicate this structure):

| \`src/lib/github.ts\`                    | GitHub API integration using Octokit. |
| \`src/routes/queue.ts\`                  | Express routes for job queue interactions, protected by middleware. |
| \`src/workers/summary.ts\`               | Processes AI-generated summaries with Redis and Prisma. |

## ‚úÖ Style & Rules

- Do **not** include any generic instructions like "Here is your README".
- Do **not** include any explanatory notes or preambles ‚Äî output should be only the README content.
- Keep descriptions clear, concise, and written in plain English.
- Use proper heading levels: \`#\` for title, \`##\` for sections.
- Maintain spacing and markdown formatting integrity.

Now, based on the repository name and file summaries provided, generate only the README.md content.`;
